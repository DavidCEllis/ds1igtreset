# DS1 IGT Reset Tool #

## What is this? ##

A simple tool to reset the game time in a PC Dark Souls PTDE savefile.
Intended for anyone doing NG+ speedruns so the timer can start at 0
when beginning NG+.

## How do I use this ##

Download the .exe file under the releases tab and run it. 

A dialog should appear asking you to select the savefile you wish to 
reset the timer on. The script will read the file and reset the time
on the first character. It will also fix the hashes that have changed
due to the timer reset.

**Note**: The new time will not appear in the menu initially, when the
character is loaded the IGT will start at 0 and will then update as
expected.
